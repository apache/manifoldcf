in SharePoint connector, to dodge limits on size of response.
(Ahmet Arslan, Piergiorgio Lucidi, Joe Becknell, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-522: Wiki connector namespace tab was non-functional.
(Maciej Lizewski, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-517: Internationalization bug; leftover "&nbsp;" in the

and corrected.
(Shigeki Kobayashi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-497: Add Lists support to the SharePoint connector.
(Ahmet Arslan, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-500: Tests were hanging or otherwise doing strange

code installed.  This is accomplished by: (a) including stub non-proprietary
classes that can be compiled against, and (b) including WSDLs and XSDs
generated from proprietary .NET libraries, but which are not proprietary
themselves (according to LEGAL-137).
(Joe Becknell, Sam Ruby, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-484: The FileNet connector UI has been broken since
the i18n work was done on it.
(Joe Becknell, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-461: Mime types and document length restrictions and
commit option for Solr output connector need documentation
(Erlend Garåsen)

longer inside a transaction.
(Marcin Goss, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-473: Split the ManifoldCF site into two distinct pieces.
One is housed under "site/trunk" and contains the project site.  The other
is housed under "trunk/site" and generates the release documentation.

(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-471: Replace broken HSQLDB 2.2.8 with a trunk build.

set of pooling classes.  This gives us better control and makes failures
on long crawls less likely.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-469: Hook up context listener to catch web application
shutdown more efficiently.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-453: Getting deadlock problems and other issues with
Derby 10.8.1.1.
(Karl Wright)

(Karl Wright, Alex Ott)

CONNECTORS-455: Fix an internationalization error on the max activities
and max bandwidth reports.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-450: Make sure all ant exec operations check properly for
errors.  This should prevent people from getting a bad dependencies
build if they have the wrong svn client (for instance).
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-430: An error should be returned if invalid seeds are typed
into the seeds list for the web connector
(Erlend Garåsen, Karl Wright)

better consistency.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-440: Build should exclude integration content from external
sources.
(Karl Wright, Shinichiro Abe)

CONNECTORS-437: Change the ant jar distribution model so that no
binary files are included in the source distribution.  All of them are now
downloaded via the ant "download-dependencies" target.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-434: Describe which licenses we select for our dual-licensed
jars.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-433: Update copyright date.
(Karl Wright)

(Luca Stancapiano, Piergiorgio Lucidi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-422: Rearrange Velocity templates so that there's one
template per tab.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-381: Add an OpenSearchServer UI test.  While we were
at it fixed a broken CMIS UI.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-421: Add hooks to permit agents "process" to be reset
by ManifoldCF.resetEnvironment().
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-420: Revise the way we use Velocity so that we can make
better use of it for internationalization purposes, and for things like loops
etc.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-419: Alfresco Connector needs to invoke the ingestDocument for each d:content property of a node
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-417: CMIS Connector creates documentURI with wrong value when version is null. 
Now the documentURI to get the content stream is retrieved from the CMIS server using an internal method of the OpenCMIS API.
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-416: Fix web connector authentication tab.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-415: Fix script language documentation.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-414: Fix incorrect path in executecommand.sh, start-webapps.sh

engine and in OpenSearchServer connector.
(Luca Stancapiano, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-409: Set mcf-ui-core.jar to all the examples lib.
(Shinichiro Abe)

CONNECTORS-408: Rearrange the script-engine directory in a manner
consistent with other dist directories, and also use a different env variable
(ENGINE_HOME) so that we don't conflict with MCF_HOME.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-407: Set the executable bit in the distribution directory
for .sh files during ant build.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-405: Do not include sources in binary distribution.  This
is no longer essential since we deliver built jars for all the connectors
now.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-327: Share the web applications among all the examples.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-402: Change the ant build process to produce two artifacts -
one with proprietary material, and the other without.  This allows for
releases that include built connectors even though we do not ship the
proprietary material.
(Karl Wright, Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-403: Fix the sidecar process scripts to use the same
definition for MCF_HOME as everything else uses.  Also promote these
scripts to the root level in their individual process directory.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-401: Update the website with some material about the project
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-351: Alfresco Connector documentation must be updated

(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-392: Complete translation to Japanese of index.xml and
concepts.xml.
(Hitoshi Ozawa)

CONNECTORS-388: Incorporate Apache Velocity as a connector UI rendering
option, and modify the CMIS connector's UI to use it as an example.
(Piergiorgio Lucidi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-391: Multiprocess example web apps didn't work, due to missing
jars.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-390: JDBC drivers cannot work from anything other than the
root classpath.  This is because of a flaw with JDBC.  I've changed the instructions
accordingly, and provided built-in support for all drivers the JDBC connector
knows about.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-389: Chemistry in-memory war renaming breaks mvn-bootstrap
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-329: Upgrade to OpenCMIS 0.6.0
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-366: Internationalized Solr connector fully.
(Hitoshi Ozawa, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-318: Add debugging output for XML parsing errors.  The
code assumes UTF-8 encoding of the stream, and only outputs the first 64K.
This should be sufficient for most situations though.
(Martin Goldhahn, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-355: Fix some remaining uninternationalized strings.
(Hitoshi Ozawa)

CONNECTORS-353: Ship .wsdd configuration files as part of connector
jars rather than separate files with configuration parameters.  This
simplifies the building and deployment of the SharePoint and Meridio
connectors considerably.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-352: Remove duplicate logfile property output for tests.
(Martin Goldhahn)

CONNECTORS-344: Fix OpenSearchServer UI so that data is not lost between posts.

Alfresco, CMIS, and OpenSearchServer connectors.  Fix broken tabs
in the Alfresco and CMIS connectors.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-342: Fix bad HTML in the File System connector.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-330: Add infrastructure that permits the database class
to initialize a connection every time it is pulled from the pool.  This is
necessary to support HSQLDB, because a number of HSQLDB's states
are actually maintained in the JDBC driver and thus cannot be managed
well in a pooled connection paradigm.
(Fred Toussi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-321: Correct a problem with external HSQLDB databases
where the schema wasn't being reliably set for the session.
(Fred Toussi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-319: Added a shutdown hook to the AgentRun command,
so that if you ^C out of it you can rerun.

jars.
(Karl Wright)

(Shinichiro Abe)

CONNECTORS-313: Reorganize the dist directory to include a multiprocess
example as well as a single process example.
(Shinichiro Abe, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-320: Fix issues with remote HSQLDB driver having to do
with schema discovery.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-308: Get the alfresco connector integration tests to run
under ant.
(Piergiorgio Lucidi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-310: Get the alfresco connector to build with Maven on a clean
system.  This involves pushing some of the dependencies that are not available
via the current maven repository into the local repository.  I wound up just
changing the bouncycastle dep to 140 instead of 137, but did not change the
others because I wasn't sure of the potential effects.
(Piergiorgio Lucidi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-311: added missing licenses
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-312: Move the Meridio web service into a separate package,
like we did for the SharePoint 3.0 plugin.

(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-302: Add a specific Server tab for CMIS-related configuration information
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-303: Maven build doesn't consider HTML and JS files for the connector
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-284: HSQLDB runs out of memory on an extended load
test, and had other problems too.  A new version of the db software was
needed to correct this issue.  Thanks to the HSQLDB team for their
assistance!
(Fred Toussi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-299: Handle Postgresql 9.1's newfound ability to throw
deadlock conditions on transaction ends.
(Erlend Garåsen, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-298: Improve the SSL error message when no trusted
certs are found.
(Michael Kelleher, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-297: Add a description of ant download-dependencies for
Building the SharePoint connector to how-to-build-and-deploy.html.
(Shinichiro Abe)

CONNECTORS-295: Add the support for multivalue properties
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-296: Make independent the configuration against the WARs version for integration tests
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-292: Problems with mvn-bootstrap.bat.  Also excluded (hopefully
temporarily) the HSQLDBext tests from the Maven build, since their properties.xml
conflict with HSQLDB tests.
(Luca Stancapiano, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-293: Fix the how-to-build-and-deploy documentation to include
the right version of jcifs.
(Luca Stancapiano, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-290: Revamp the way docpriorities are handled so as to avoid
flooding the jobqueue with documents that have a docpriority value but
a job or document status incompatible with stuffing.  This should help a lot
in very large crawls with multiple jobs.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-291: Active Directory authority reconnect logic had a
pathological case when server forcibly closed connection.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-209: Add support for remote HSQLDB instances.  There are
now configuration parameters for specifying protocol, server, and instance
name, which if specified cause the HSQLDB driver to communicate to the
specified remote instance.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-287: An Alfresco connector would be helpful
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-289: Wrong version of the OpenCMIS InMemory Server war in the page How to build and deploy
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-285: Provide a way through the IJobManager interface
and through the API to check on the status of a job without asking
for the counts of documents, which yields a full table scan.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-279: Prevent reindex or analyze from taking place within
a transaction.  This was causing hangs on our load tests.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-283: Upgrade to jcifs.jar 1.3.17 in the ant build (download-dependencies target).
(Shinichiro Abe)

CONNECTORS-282: Change order in which the incremental ingester does
things so we don't typically get unique constraint violation warnings in
the log.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-280: The job state "DELETESTARTINGUP" was not being
checked for in the status.  This meant that during the time that a
job delete was beginning, "Not yet run" would be displayed as the status.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-277: Add the ability to select namespaces and title
prefixes to the Wiki connector.
(Tobias Wunderlich, Karl Wright)

in the ant build (download-dependencies target).
(Shinichiro Abe, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-276: Pull down jtds and mysql drivers from maven repository
in the ant build (download-dependencies target),
and add these dependencies in appropriate places in the maven build as
well.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-259: Enable support for MySQL in JDBC connector.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-187: Fix how the worker threads handle document deletion
service interruptions.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-271: Wiki connector now has end-user documentation.
(Karl Wright)
