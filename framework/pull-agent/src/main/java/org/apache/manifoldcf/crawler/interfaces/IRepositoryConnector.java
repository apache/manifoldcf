/** This interface describes an instance of a connection between a repository and ManifoldCF's
* standard "pull" ingestion agent.
*
* Each instance of this interface is used in only one thread at a time.  Connection Pooling
* on these kinds of objects is performed by the factory which instantiates repository connectors
* from symbolic names and config parameters, and is pooled by these parameters.  That is, a pooled connector
* handle is used only if all the connection parameters for the handle match.
*
* Implementers of this interface should provide a default constructor which has this signature:
*
* xxx();
*
* Connectors are either configured or not.  If configured, they will persist in a pool, and be
* reused multiple times.  Certain methods of a connector may be called before the connector is
* configured.  This includes basically all methods that permit inspection of the connector's
* capabilities.  The complete list is:
*
*
* The purpose of the repository connector is to allow documents to be fetched from the repository.
*
* Each repository connector describes a set of documents that are known only to that connector.
* It therefore establishes a space of document identifiers.  Each connector will only ever be
* asked to deal with identifiers that have in some way originated from the connector.
*
* Documents are fetched by ManifoldCF in three stages.  First, the addSeedDocuments() method is called in the connector
* implementation.  This method is meant to add a set of document identifiers to the queue.  When ManifoldCF is ready
* to process a document, the document identifier is used to obtain a current document version string, using the
* getDocumentVersions() method (the second stage).  This version string is used to decide whether or not the
* third stage need be called for the document or not.  The third stage is responsible for sending document content
* to the output, and for extracting any references to additional documents, and consists of the processDocuments() method.
*
* All of these methods interact with ManifoldCF by means of an "activity" interface.  For example, an IVersionActivity object
* is passed to the getDocumentVersions() method, and that object contains methods that are necessary for getDocumentVersions()
* to do its job.  A similar architecture is used throughout the connector framework.

  // that have been added, changed, or deleted will eventually be discovered.  In that case, model
