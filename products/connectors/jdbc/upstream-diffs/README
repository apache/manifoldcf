The jdbc connector can, in theory, work with any JDBC driver that has been added into the list it knows about.  The code as granted knows about the following:

Mssql/Sybase (via open-source jtds)
Postgresql (via an appropriate open-source postgresql JDBC driver)
Oracle (via a proprietary, but freely downloadable Oracle JDBC driver)

The connector was tested against the following versions of the above:

Oracle: oracle jdbc4 jdk1.4 version 10.1.0-2.0
Jtds: version 1.2.2, downloadable from SourceForge
Postgresql: the debian postgresql driver package for postgresql 8.3.7, aka libpg-java, version 8.2-504-2.

None of these required upstream changes.
