The LiveLink connector requires a client library from OpenText in
order to function.  The client jar is call lapi.jar, and the version we
have tested against can be found in the LAPI 9.7.1 package from
OpenText.  For some modes of operation, you may also need llssl.jar
from the same package.  Copy those jars to this directory, and run
ManifoldCF using the appropriate means.

If you find there are incompatibilities between your version of lapi.jar
and the one your release of ManifoldCF was built against, you must build
ManifoldCF yourself, and include a copy of your jars prior to building,
in the directory "connectors/livelink/lib-proprietary".

More can be found in the "how-to-build-and-deploy.html"
documentation page.
