ManifoldCF Change Log
$Id$

======================= 1.3-dev =====================

======================= Release 1.2 =====================

CONNECTORS-678: Add missing noteModification() method calls, so
that jobqueue is reanalyzed more frequently.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-681: ElasticSearch and OpenSearchServer connectors
both misused the File object passed to them in checkFileIndexable()
in order to see if the extension was a supported one.  Instead they
should have been checking the URL.  Added that code as well as changed
the JCIFS connector to check indexability using the URL means.
(konrad, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-679: Web connector hangs during throttling.  Reason
appears to be that it is possible to interrupt the beginRead() method
after it goes into "obtain estimate" mode.  Added code to make it clean
up in that case.  Also applied to RSS connector.
(Erlend Garåsen, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-677: Close body streams where required.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-647: Add the resource.name hint to the Solr output
connector.
(Maciej Li¿ewski, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-623: A better fix, overriding the posting method for

the behavior to work like MCF 1.0.1 now.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-645: Handle null data properly in worker thread.
(Maciej Li¿ewski, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-644: Restart button did not work.

(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-620: It was possible for the JDBC Connector to leak
JDBC connections under some error conditions.
(Anthony Leonard, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-619: Include slf4j jars in multiprocess agents classpath.
This was causing Solrj to not work on multiprocess deployments.
(Erlend Garåsen, Karl Wright) 

CONNECTORS-618: MySQL orders indexes so that NULL values are first.
This is a problem for the stuffer query, which then must go through
millions of rows before it finds the one it is looking for.
(Shigeki Kobayashi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-616: Work around Solr 4.0 or Jetty bug where connections
are dropped randomly under multithreaded load.  Broken pipe exceptions
are now retried after a minute, for up to three times, before the Solr
connector concludes that the document cannot be indexed and skips it.
(Shinichiro Abe, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-613: Add a way of getting a document's mime type
to Solr, since Tika needs mime type in order to extract content
since Solr 4.0.0.
(Shinichiro Abe, Karl Wright)

(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-582: Upgrade to official httpcomponents 4.2.3
release.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-612: Disable HttpClient retries everywhere.

with solrj, so disable retries explicitly.
(Ahmet Arslan, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-609: Solrj doesn't always set the code property of
its http exceptions right, so we need to parse it out ourselves.

CONNECTORS-608: Solr connector times out chronically on some
documents.
(David Morana, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-607: Handle multi-valued parameters properly in the
Solr connector.
(Minoru Osuka, Shinichiro Abe, Karl Wright)

(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-604: Make headers exactly the same as for MCF 1.0.1.

CONNECTORS-605: Maven build is broken: commons-httpclient version is missing
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-601: Revise algorithm for screening out documents that
are not text in the web connector.  Since CJK characters mess up the
old definition of "strange" character, use the more-limited definition of
all non-whitespace characters less than 32.
(Shinichiro Abe, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-600: Add a field to the RSS connector that contains
document origination date in ISO 8601 format.

(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-587: Manual startup did not properly set lastchecktime.
(Maciej Li¿ewski, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-578: Refactor Livelink connector, and add support for
general metadata.
(David Morana, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-584: Fix MySQL use of indexes on ORDER-BY stuffing query.
Turns out that MySQL will not order by an index unless only the first column
in the index is specified in the ordering criteria.  Still need to check if this
breaks other databases like PostgreSQL, Derby, or HSQLDB.
(Shigeki Kobayashi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-583: Catch MySQL lock timeout, and retry that transaction.
(Shigeki Kobayashi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-581: Port OpenSearchServer connector and ElasticSearch
connector to httpcomponents.

ant and maven dependencies.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-579: Add untrusted, unverified https support to the RSS
connector.
(David Morana, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-575: Modify Livelink connector build to use stub only when
there is no lapi.jar available.  This is to support the fact that lapi jars are
not compatible from release to release, class-wise, so clients will need to
build this connector against the jar that they have, instead of the jar that
we have.
(David Morana, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-577: Typo in language message properties which cause stack
traces
(Erlend Garåsen)

(Shigeki Kobayashi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-569: Add User-Agent header for Wiki connector.
Newer versions of Wiki need this.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-560: Use standard patch if "svn patch" is not available.
(Alex Ott, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-555: Alfresco maven build is broken
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-551: Resetting agents process causes job's seed
documents to be flipped into the PURGATORY state, which in turn
may cause the documents to be deleted and the job to be shut down
if the seed documents are the only documents.
(Martin Gielow, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-546: Rework the how-to-build-and-deploy documentation
page to be clearer and also cover the combined war.

(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-407: Set the executable bit in the distribution directory
for .sh files during ant build.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-405: Do not include sources in binary distribution.  This

now.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-327: Share the web applications among all the examples.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-402: Change the ant build process to produce two artifacts -
one with proprietary material, and the other without.  This allows for
releases that include built connectors even though we do not ship the
proprietary material.
(Karl Wright, Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-403: Fix the sidecar process scripts to use the same
definition for MCF_HOME as everything else uses.  Also promote these

CONNECTORS-391: Multiprocess example web apps didn't work, due to missing
jars.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-390: JDBC drivers cannot work from anything other than the
root classpath.  This is because of a flaw with JDBC.  I've changed the instructions
accordingly, and provided built-in support for all drivers the JDBC connector
knows about.
(Karl Wright)

(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-329: Upgrade to OpenCMIS 0.6.0

CONNECTORS-318: Add debugging output for XML parsing errors.  The
code assumes UTF-8 encoding of the stream, and only outputs the first 64K.
This should be sufficient for most situations though.
(Martin Goldhahn, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-355: Fix some remaining uninternationalized strings.
(Hitoshi Ozawa)

CONNECTORS-353: Ship .wsdd configuration files as part of connector

in the Alfresco and CMIS connectors.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-342: Fix bad HTML in the File System connector.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-330: Add infrastructure that permits the database class
to initialize a connection every time it is pulled from the pool.  This is
necessary to support HSQLDB, because a number of HSQLDB's states
are actually maintained in the JDBC driver and thus cannot be managed
well in a pooled connection paradigm.
(Fred Toussi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-321: Correct a problem with external HSQLDB databases
where the schema wasn't being reliably set for the session.
(Fred Toussi, Karl Wright)

with schema discovery.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-308: Get the alfresco connector integration tests to run
under ant.
(Piergiorgio Lucidi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-310: Get the alfresco connector to build with Maven on a clean
system.  This involves pushing some of the dependencies that are not available
via the current maven repository into the local repository.  I wound up just
changing the bouncycastle dep to 140 instead of 137, but did not change the
others because I wasn't sure of the potential effects.
(Piergiorgio Lucidi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-311: added missing licenses
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

needed to correct this issue.  Thanks to the HSQLDB team for their
assistance!

(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-296: Make independent the configuration against the WARs version for integration tests
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-292: Problems with mvn-bootstrap.bat.  Also excluded (hopefully
temporarily) the HSQLDBext tests from the Maven build, since their properties.xml
conflict with HSQLDB tests.

CONNECTORS-293: Fix the how-to-build-and-deploy documentation to include
the right version of jcifs.
(Luca Stancapiano, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-290: Revamp the way docpriorities are handled so as to avoid

in very large crawls with multiple jobs.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-291: Active Directory authority reconnect logic had a
pathological case when server forcibly closed connection.
(Karl Wright)

(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-289: Wrong version of the OpenCMIS InMemory Server war in the page How to build and deploy
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-285: Provide a way through the IJobManager interface
and through the API to check on the status of a job without asking
for the counts of documents, which yields a full table scan.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-279: Prevent reindex or analyze from taking place within
a transaction.  This was causing hangs on our load tests.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-283: Upgrade to jcifs.jar 1.3.17 in the ant build (download-dependencies target).
(Shinichiro Abe)

CONNECTORS-282: Change order in which the incremental ingester does
things so we don't typically get unique constraint violation warnings in
the log.

CONNECTORS-280: The job state "DELETESTARTINGUP" was not being
checked for in the status.  This meant that during the time that a

prefixes to the Wiki connector.
(Tobias Wunderlich, Karl Wright)

======================= Release 0.1 =======================
Release Date:  See http://incubator.apache.org/connectors for the official release date.

CONNECTORS-149: Expire threads did not obey rules as far as deleting documents
belonging to other jobs.  Also, the test for whether a document was shared between
jobs did not take the output connection into account.  Finally, I found an infinite
loop in the job delete stuffer thread code.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-147: Disable PDF's everywhere except for user documentation.
(Grant Ingersoll, David Crossley, Karl Wright)

when a parameter was used for the encoding; the PostgreSQL documentation
specifies that it must be a quoted string in that case.

in carrydown data and in hopcount information.
