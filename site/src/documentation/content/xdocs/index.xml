	<title>What Is ManifoldCF?</title>
	<p>ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr.  ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target repositories that permits them to enforce source-repository security policies.</p>
	<p>Currently included connectors support FileNet P8 (IBM), Documentum (EMC), LiveLink (OpenText), Patriarch (Memex), Meridio (Autonomy), Windows shares (Microsoft), and SharePoint (Microsoft).  Also included are a general file system connector, a general JDBC connector, a general RSS crawler, and a general web crawler.  Currently supported targets include Apache Solr and QBase (formerly MetaCarta) GTS.  The complete repository compatibility list can be found <a href="http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CONNECTORS/SupportedConnectors">here</a>.</p>
	<p>The original ManifoldCF code base was granted by MetaCarta, Inc., to the Apache Software Foundation in December 2009.  The MetaCarta effort represented more than five years of successful development and testing in multiple, challenging enterprise environments.</p>

        <title>Incubation Status</title>
        <p>Apache ManifoldCF (formerly Apache Connectors Framework) is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Lucene PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

	<title>A philosophical note about third-party repositories</title>
	<p>Many of the connectors included with ManifoldCF currently require third-party libraries, packages, or other licensed materials in order to be built.  The code for these connectors can be distributed under Apache guidelines because they are conditionally compiled; that is, you as a developer must supply the necessary third-party components before the connector will build.  While we have every intention of trying to reduce the number of affected connectors by means of clean-room development under the auspices of ASF, realistically the current situation will not change in any dramatic way very quickly.  The focus of this group remains primarily on providing solutions.</p>
	<p>The required libraries, tools, and procedures for building each of these connectors are well documented in the Wiki pages for this project.</p>
