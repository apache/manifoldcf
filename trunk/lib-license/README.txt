Welcome to the Apache ManifoldCF project!
-----------------------------------------

Apache ManifoldCF is a multi-repository crawler framework, with multiple connectors.

For a complete description of the ManifoldCF project, team composition, source
code repositories, and other details, please see the ManifoldCF web site at
http://manifoldcf.apache.org


Getting Started
---------------

This lib package is meant to be used in conjunction with the corresponding
source package.

1. Download and unpacked the source package.

2. Create a directory called "lib" at the root level in the source tree.

3. Copy the files in this package into the lib directory in the source tree.
   
Now you are ready to build the ManifoldCF sources.


Files Included In Apache ManifoldCF Lib Distributions
--------------------------------------------------

lib
  The directory containing the Apache ManifoldCF binary dependencies.


Licensing
---------

The binary dependencies of ManifoldCF are licensed in a manner
consistent with redistribution under Apache License 2.0. See the files
