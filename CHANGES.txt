ManifoldCF Change Log
$Id$

======================= 2.14-dev =====================

CONNECTORS-1609: SharePoint: Treat document fetch 403 and 503 errors as meaning
insufficient permissions, and skip the document.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1605: HTML-extractor: Use body tag if specified tag is not available.
(Olivier Tavard)

======================= Release 2.13 =====================

CONNECTORS-1498: Redevelop the jcifs connector to use the newer jcifs-ng.jar.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1588: Apply override of jcifs properties only if they are not
already specified.
(Cihad Guzel)

CONNECTORS-1579: Fix for JDBC connector's incorrect tracking of rejected
documents.
(Donald Van den Driessche, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1535: Modify documentum server script on Linux because otherwise
dfc.properties can't be found.
(James Thomas)

CONNECTORS-1565: Upgrades commons-collections to 3.2.2. Please consider instructions

custom connector makes use of the org.apache.commons.collections.functors package.
(Markus Schuch)

CONNECTORS-1506: Add fixes for CSS preservation when opening in new tab in UI.
(Kishore Kumar)

======================= Release 2.12 =====================

CONNECTORS-1562: HopDeleteDeps table was using NULL values instead of empty
strings, but nothing else knew about this and therefore all queries involving invalidation
that used empty strings would not work as expected.  This was a long-standing problem,
in effect since at least 2012.
(Karl Wright, Tim Steenbeke)

CONNECTORS-1522: Add SSL and basic auth support to ElasticSearch connector.
(Karl Wright, Steph van Schwalkwyk)

CONNECTORS-1556: Modify retry strategy for Tika Service connector.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1532: Documentum connector would not remove docs that
were no longer eligible because of path changes or mime type changes.
(James Thomas, Karl Wright)

======================= Release 2.11 =====================

CONNECTORS-1533: Fix problems with Solrj 7.4.0 integration.
(Julien Massiera, Karl Wright)

(Irindu Nugawela, Piergiorgio Lucidi)

(Karl Wright, Kishore Kumar)

CONNECTORS-1507: Restarting the cluster could leave documents
that were formerly active in PENDING or PENDINGPURGATORY without
document priorities.

CONNECTORS-1503: Fix for Solr standard update handler
parameter transmission to Solr.

======================= Release 2.10 =====================

CONNECTORS-1500: HTML Extractor transformation connector contribution
(Olivier Tavard)

CONNECTORS-1501: Add dynamic snippet for the next Apache event
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-1437: Documentation for the CMIS Output Connector
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-1356: Initial implementation of the CMIS Output Connector
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-1462: Add support for rootPath attribute in File System Connector repository
(Luis Cabaceira)

CONNECTORS-1499: Reading in JSON in exported format did not
preserve the order because the new JSON parser does things in
hash order for keys in objects.  The fix is to use the more verbose
alternate form if there's any possibility of order dependency being
needed.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1493: Jira connector could not fetch acls.
(Damien Collis, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1488: Use a mime type that ElasticSearch 6.x allows.
(Richard Wardrobe)

CONNECTORS-1485: Prevent Form submit on Enter key press
(Maxence SAUNIER, Kishore Kumar)

CONNECTORS-1482: Improve solr connector handling of include/exclude
for mime types to be case insenstive and to actually reject documents
if upstream connector ignores or doesn't call checkMimeTypeIndexable().

CONNECTORS-1476: TLS/SSL support for MySQL/MariaDB database connections
(Markus Schuch)

======================= Release 2.9 =====================

CONNECTORS-1479: Correct classpath for running alfresco-webscript
tests.
(Shinichiro Abe, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1478: Proprietary example missing CSS style files.
(Markus Schuch, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1473: Alfresco authority did not return user token, just
groups.
(Phillip Rhodes, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1471: File system output connector's delete method
was completely broken.
(David Hotchkiss)

CONNECTORS-1469: The slack notification connector is now properly
integrated into the maven build.
(Markus Schuch)

CONNECTORS-1468: Adds Rocket.Chat Notification Connector
(Markus Schuch)

CONNECTORS-1459: Allow the Tika service to override the mime type
in the metadata.
(Julien Massiera)

CONNECTORS-1458: Update to use SolrJ 7.0.0.  This required some
revision to the connector, and also to make zookeeper.jar available
to all connectors as a root dependency.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1453: Integrate poi 3.17, which seems to fix the
classloader issue in 3.15.  Reverted the reassignment of poi and
dependencies to root-level classpath accordingly.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1456: Tentative fix for API issue exporting jobs in JSON
format.  Basically, simple valued array elements did not work.
(Adrian Conlon, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1455: Eventually skip a locked shared drive file, rather
than aborting the job.
(Julien Massiera, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1452: The runzookeeper.bat/runzookeeper.sh scripts
were not properly starting zookeeper, because the zookeeper "main
process" uses log4j 1.2.x methods not compatible with the log4j-1.2-api
shim.  We have to include a 1.2.x jar and use that when starting the
zookeeper process.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1451: Tika extractor was causing some out-of-memory
events to occur for simple crawls, so I increased the default memory
allocated in the examples to 512M.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1450: Tika extractor cannot process MS Office files due
to a dependency problem.  The dependency issue is that poi-ooxml-schemas
is apparently accessed via reflection, and the class lookup does not
apparently use the current classloader, but rather some other classloader.
This requires the entire poi* set of jars, and all dependencies, to be
included in ManifoldCF's core jar list.
(Karl Wright)

======================= Release 2.8 =====================

CONNECTORS-1445: Fix timezone handling in reports to use browser timezone
and add a timezone field for the editjob schedule page as well. 
(Kishore Kumar, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1447: Update postgresql driver to the most current version.
This should allow error free operation with Postgresql versions back to
version 8.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1446: Confluence connector's UI was broken; protocol
selection was not working.
(Ty Taylor, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1444: Documentum connector needs the ability to skip
corrupted files.
(Tamizh Kumaran Thamizharasan, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1440: Add support for created date in File System connector.
(Steph van Schalkwyk, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1438: Wrong content-type parse in Solr connector caused
failure when content type contained a charset.
(Kenta Kasahara, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1436: Porting of CMIS Output Connector from 2.6 to 2.8
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-1434: Escape filenames in Solr Http headers to match spec.
This is a workaround for a fix that really should be in HttpClient.
(Karl Wright, Tamizh Kumaran Thamizharasan)

CONNECTORS-1433: Add pipeline specification to ES connector.
(Steph van Schalkwyk, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1432: Fix deleting stale check methods from window object
(Steph van Schalkwyk, Karl Wright, Kishore Kumar)

up).

(Cihad Guzel)

deletes work.
(Julien Massiera, Karl Wright)

(Cihad Guzel)

(Cihad Guzel)

CONNECTORS-1415: Return descriptive error message when Internal Server Error occurs
(Kishore Kumar)

(Markus Schuch, Kishore Kumar, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1413: Fix object equality bug at Cmis Authority Connector.
(Furkan KAMACI, JC)

CONNECTORS-1290: Merge Nuxeo Connector.  This also required going
to log4j 2.x.  This connector is a work in progress but since a great deal
of work has been done and the connector is nearly done, it's time to
commit to trunk.
(David Arroyo Escobar, Rafa Haro, Karl Wright)

such as directories should call noDocument() on those documents if they
want incremental behavior.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-993: Pipeline code not handling "no document" case properly.
This problem was an oversight of the new pipeline code.  Essentially,
transformation connectors could choose not to send a document onward
to the next stage.  If this happened, then the document version information
for the corresponding output connection would never get written, and
no incremental-ness would be possible.
I fixed this by introducing a "noDocument()" IOutputAddActivity method,
which transformation connectors should call when they reject a document.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-992: Add a test to exercise ServiceInterruption within
a connector.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-990: Revamp IRepositoryConnector API to no longer separate

pipeline.
(2) Revamped the document lifecycle so they are batched together (which isn't
perfect; see CONNECTORS-980).
(Karl Wright, Takumi Yoshida)

CONNECTORS-971: Use a generic "seeding version string" to track the last
seeding event for every job.  This abstracts away from time intervals and
permits seeding based on things like transaction IDs.

for ManifoldCF Javadocs.

are being delivered.

don't run out of zookeeper resources on Windows.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-860: Remove zookeeper.jar from a number of contexts

the classpath at a time.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-858: HDFS repository and output connectors need to be
fully compatible with multiple Hadoop 2.2.0 file system protocols.

CONNECTORS-854: Enable stale connection checks on all http fetches.
Not sure why it was disabled long ago, but it causes problems when
connections are pooled for longer than the server wants the connection
to survive.
(Shinichiro Abe, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-855: Use -D switch in start-webapps scripts to point
to the right properties.xml file.  Otherwise who knows where the
properties may come from.

(Tishan DahanaYakage, Piergiorgio Lucidi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-846: Once a service had grabbed all connector
instances, but was not using them any more, it would not release
them for other cluster members to use.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-844: Remove "per JVM" from connection maximum
messages in crawler UI.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-842: Update documentation to describe the functioning

(David Morana, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-839: Fix our CloudSolrServer usage to use multipart

CONNECTORS-831: Refactor ReprioritizationTracker so that it uses
the interface/factory paradigm.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-830: Stuffer thread throttling now works globally, not
just locally.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-781: Add support for multiple agents processes.  This
ticket involved changing much of the underlying infrastructure for
the framework, including adding lock manager features, revamping the
agents framework, building tests, and adding schema features that
allow for an agents process failure.  All in all, a very significant change,
which could well have introduced various instabilities.  Please don't
hesitate to note any issues.
(Graeme Seaton, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-813: For list items, obtain the url from the EncodedAbsURL
metadata field.  This should allow list items to be clicked on in search results.
(Mark Libucha, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-812: SharePoint connector needs to ignore constructs
that it doesn't understand when enumerating list contents, because
under some configurations, SharePoint lists things that aren't list items
there.
(Mark Libucha, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-810: Update JDBC connector documentation, and add
documentation for the JDBC authority connector.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-805: Add author name/email support to RSS connector.

repohistory rows.
(Marcello Lorenzi, Karl Wright)

compatible!  JDBC authority queries now require explicit return column
names for the user id and token queries!
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-798: Bring JDBC connector support for CLOBs into the
modern era.  This also required extension of the CharacterInputFile
paradigm slightly - a new method to find the utf8 byte length was needed.

database table for the jobstatus screen.
(Graeme Seaton, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-796: Fix NPE in RSS connector having to do with

is to support federated authorization models such as what SharePoint
Claim Space fundamentally does, where there are multiple authorities
per repository.
WARNING: Schema change!

that jobqueue is reanalyzed more frequently.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-681: ElasticSearch and OpenSearchServer connectors
both misused the File object passed to them in checkFileIndexable()
in order to see if the extension was a supported one.  Instead they
should have been checking the URL.  Added that code as well as changed
the JCIFS connector to check indexability using the URL means.
(konrad, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-679: Web connector hangs during throttling.  Reason
appears to be that it is possible to interrupt the beginRead() method

CONNECTORS-677: Close body streams where required.

connector.
(Maciej Li¿ewski, Karl Wright)

This was causing Solrj to not work on multiprocess deployments.
(Erlend Garåsen, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-618: MySQL orders indexes so that NULL values are first.
This is a problem for the stuffer query, which then must go through
millions of rows before it finds the one it is looking for.
(Shigeki Kobayashi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-616: Work around Solr 4.0 or Jetty bug where connections
are dropped randomly under multithreaded load.  Broken pipe exceptions
are now retried after a minute, for up to three times, before the Solr
connector concludes that the document cannot be indexed and skips it.
(Shinichiro Abe, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-613: Add a way of getting a document's mime type
to Solr, since Tika needs mime type in order to extract content
since Solr 4.0.0.

documents.
(David Morana, Karl Wright)

are not text in the web connector.  Since CJK characters mess up the
old definition of "strange" character, use the more-limited definition of
all non-whitespace characters less than 32.

CONNECTORS-600: Add a field to the RSS connector that contains
document origination date in ISO 8601 format.

CONNECTORS-578: Refactor Livelink connector, and add support for
general metadata.
(David Morana, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-584: Fix MySQL use of indexes on ORDER-BY stuffing query.
Turns out that MySQL will not order by an index unless only the first column
in the index is specified in the ordering criteria.  Still need to check if this

build this connector against the jar that they have, instead of the jar that
we have.

CONNECTORS-577: Typo in language message properties which cause stack
traces

CONNECTORS-497: Add Lists support to the SharePoint connector.
(Ahmet Arslan, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-420: Revise the way we use Velocity so that we can make
better use of it for internationalization purposes, and for things like loops
etc.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-419: Alfresco Connector needs to invoke the ingestDocument for each d:content property of a node
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-417: CMIS Connector creates documentURI with wrong value when version is null.
Now the documentURI to get the content stream is retrieved from the CMIS server using an internal method of the OpenCMIS API.
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-416: Fix web connector authentication tab.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-415: Fix script language documentation.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-409: Set mcf-ui-core.jar to all the examples lib.
(Shinichiro Abe)

CONNECTORS-408: Rearrange the script-engine directory in a manner
consistent with other dist directories, and also use a different env variable
(ENGINE_HOME) so that we don't conflict with MCF_HOME.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-407: Set the executable bit in the distribution directory
for .sh files during ant build.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-405: Do not include sources in binary distribution.  This
is no longer essential since we deliver built jars for all the connectors
now.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-327: Share the web applications among all the examples.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-402: Change the ant build process to produce two artifacts -
one with proprietary material, and the other without.  This allows for
releases that include built connectors even though we do not ship the
proprietary material.
(Karl Wright, Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-403: Fix the sidecar process scripts to use the same
definition for MCF_HOME as everything else uses.  Also promote these

CONNECTORS-391: Multiprocess example web apps didn't work, due to missing
jars.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-390: JDBC drivers cannot work from anything other than the
root classpath.  This is because of a flaw with JDBC.  I've changed the instructions
accordingly, and provided built-in support for all drivers the JDBC connector
knows about.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-389: Chemistry in-memory war renaming breaks mvn-bootstrap
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-329: Upgrade to OpenCMIS 0.6.0

CONNECTORS-318: Add debugging output for XML parsing errors.  The
code assumes UTF-8 encoding of the stream, and only outputs the first 64K.
This should be sufficient for most situations though.
(Martin Goldhahn, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-355: Fix some remaining uninternationalized strings.
(Hitoshi Ozawa)

CONNECTORS-353: Ship .wsdd configuration files as part of connector
jars rather than separate files with configuration parameters.  This

(Martin Goldhahn)

CONNECTORS-344: Fix OpenSearchServer UI so that data is not lost between posts.

in the Alfresco and CMIS connectors.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-342: Fix bad HTML in the File System connector.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-330: Add infrastructure that permits the database class
to initialize a connection every time it is pulled from the pool.  This is
necessary to support HSQLDB, because a number of HSQLDB's states
are actually maintained in the JDBC driver and thus cannot be managed
well in a pooled connection paradigm.
(Fred Toussi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-321: Correct a problem with external HSQLDB databases
where the schema wasn't being reliably set for the session.
(Fred Toussi, Karl Wright)

with schema discovery.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-308: Get the alfresco connector integration tests to run
under ant.
(Piergiorgio Lucidi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-310: Get the alfresco connector to build with Maven on a clean
system.  This involves pushing some of the dependencies that are not available
via the current maven repository into the local repository.  I wound up just
changing the bouncycastle dep to 140 instead of 137, but did not change the
others because I wasn't sure of the potential effects.
(Piergiorgio Lucidi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-311: added missing licenses
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-312: Move the Meridio web service into a separate package,
like we did for the SharePoint 3.0 plugin.
