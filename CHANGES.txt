ManifoldCF Change Log
$Id$

======================= 2.10-dev =====================

CONNECTORS-1476: TLS/SSL support for MySQL/MariaDB database connections
(Markus Schuch)

======================= Release 2.9 =====================

CONNECTORS-1474: Proprietary example missing CSS style files.
(Markus Schuch, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1473: Alfresco authority did not return user token, just
groups.
(Phillip Rhodes, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1471: File system output connector's delete method
was completely broken.
(David Hotchkiss)

CONNECTORS-1469: The slack notification connector is now properly
integrated into the maven build.
(Markus Schuch)

CONNECTORS-1468: Adds Rocket.Chat Notification Connector
(Markus Schuch)

CONNECTORS-1459: Allow the Tika service to override the mime type
in the metadata.
(Julien Massiera)

CONNECTORS-1458: Update to use SolrJ 7.0.0.  This required some
revision to the connector, and also to make zookeeper.jar available
to all connectors as a root dependency.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1453: Integrate poi 3.17, which seems to fix the
classloader issue in 3.15.  Reverted the reassignment of poi and
dependencies to root-level classpath accordingly.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1456: Tentative fix for API issue exporting jobs in JSON
format.  Basically, simple valued array elements did not work.
(Adrian Conlon, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1455: Eventually skip a locked shared drive file, rather
than aborting the job.
(Julien Massiera, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1452: The runzookeeper.bat/runzookeeper.sh scripts
were not properly starting zookeeper, because the zookeeper "main
process" uses log4j 1.2.x methods not compatible with the log4j-1.2-api
shim.  We have to include a 1.2.x jar and use that when starting the
zookeeper process.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1451: Tika extractor was causing some out-of-memory
events to occur for simple crawls, so I increased the default memory
allocated in the examples to 512M.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1450: Tika extractor cannot process MS Office files due
to a dependency problem.  The dependency issue is that poi-ooxml-schemas
is apparently accessed via reflection, and the class lookup does not
apparently use the current classloader, but rather some other classloader.
This requires the entire poi* set of jars, and all dependencies, to be
included in ManifoldCF's core jar list.
(Karl Wright)

======================= Release 2.8 =====================

CONNECTORS-1445: Fix timezone handling in reports to use browser timezone
and add a timezone field for the editjob schedule page as well. 
(Kishore Kumar, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1447: Update postgresql driver to the most current version.
This should allow error free operation with Postgresql versions back to
version 8.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1446: Confluence connector's UI was broken; protocol
selection was not working.
(Ty Taylor, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1444: Documentum connector needs the ability to skip
corrupted files.
(Tamizh Kumaran Thamizharasan, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1440: Add support for created date in File System connector.
(Steph van Schalkwyk, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1438: Wrong content-type parse in Solr connector caused
failure when content type contained a charset.
(Kenta Kasahara, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1434: Escape filenames in Solr Http headers to match spec.
This is a workaround for a fix that really should be in HttpClient.
(Karl Wright, Tamizh Kumaran Thamizharasan)

CONNECTORS-1433: Add pipeline specification to ES connector.
(Steph van Schalkwyk, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1432: Fix deleting stale check methods from window object

up).

(Cihad Guzel)

deletes work.

(Cihad Guzel)

(Cihad Guzel)

CONNECTORS-1415: Return descriptive error message when Internal Server Error occurs
(Kishore Kumar)

CONNECTORS-1414: Return descriptive error message when UI is disconnected
(Markus Schuch, Kishore Kumar, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-1413: Fix object equality bug at Cmis Authority Connector.
(Furkan KAMACI, JC)

CONNECTORS-1290: Merge Nuxeo Connector.  This also required going
to log4j 2.x.  This connector is a work in progress but since a great deal
of work has been done and the connector is nearly done, it's time to
commit to trunk.
(David Arroyo Escobar, Rafa Haro, Karl Wright)

Apache Legal advice.
(Karl Wright)

(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-996: Catch CMIS object not found exception, and
also enable CMIS derby IT test.
(Prasad Perera, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-995: Connectors dealing with non-indexable documents
such as directories should call noDocument() on those documents if they
want incremental behavior.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-993: Pipeline code not handling "no document" case properly.
This problem was an oversight of the new pipeline code.  Essentially,
transformation connectors could choose not to send a document onward
to the next stage.  If this happened, then the document version information
for the corresponding output connection would never get written, and
no incremental-ness would be possible.
I fixed this by introducing a "noDocument()" IOutputAddActivity method,
which transformation connectors should call when they reject a document.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-992: Add a test to exercise ServiceInterruption within
a connector.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-990: Revamp IRepositoryConnector API to no longer separate
getDocumentVersions() and processDocuments().  This modification basically
pushes responsibility to determine changes to the repository connector.
Backwards compatibility is maintained via code in BaseRepositoryConnector,
and new methods have been added to IProcessActivity.
WorkerThread has been largely rewritten as a result.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-991: Make Jira connector perform pre-emptive basic auth
since Jira supports guest users.

CONNECTORS-980: Output connector gets notified now when job is deleted.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-954: Revamp AmazonCloudSearch output connector completely.
(1) Remove Tika and field mapping, since that would be done upstream in the
pipeline.
(2) Revamped the document lifecycle so they are batched together (which isn't
perfect; see CONNECTORS-980).
(Karl Wright, Takumi Yoshida)

CONNECTORS-971: Use a generic "seeding version string" to track the last
seeding event for every job.  This abstracts away from time intervals and
permits seeding based on things like transaction IDs.
(Karl Wright, Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-967: Add links to Java 1.7 and ManifoldCF framework Javadoc
for ManifoldCF Javadocs.

amount and also prevent more than one zookeeper.jar from being in
the classpath at a time.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-858: HDFS repository and output connectors need to be
fully compatible with multiple Hadoop 2.2.0 file system protocols.

connections are pooled for longer than the server wants the connection
to survive.
(Shinichiro Abe, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-855: Use -D switch in start-webapps scripts to point
to the right properties.xml file.  Otherwise who knows where the

CONNECTORS-830: Stuffer thread throttling now works globally, not
just locally.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-781: Add support for multiple agents processes.  This
ticket involved changing much of the underlying infrastructure for
the framework, including adding lock manager features, revamping the
agents framework, building tests, and adding schema features that
allow for an agents process failure.  All in all, a very significant change,
which could well have introduced various instabilities.  Please don't
hesitate to note any issues.
(Graeme Seaton, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-822: Use data size as Long value, not int.

metadata field.  This should allow list items to be clicked on in search results.
(Mark Libucha, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-812: SharePoint connector needs to ignore constructs
that it doesn't understand when enumerating list contents, because
under some configurations, SharePoint lists things that aren't list items
there.
(Mark Libucha, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-810: Update JDBC connector documentation, and add
documentation for the JDBC authority connector.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-805: Add author name/email support to RSS connector.

that jobqueue is reanalyzed more frequently.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-681: ElasticSearch and OpenSearchServer connectors
both misused the File object passed to them in checkFileIndexable()
in order to see if the extension was a supported one.  Instead they
should have been checking the URL.  Added that code as well as changed
the JCIFS connector to check indexability using the URL means.
(konrad, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-679: Web connector hangs during throttling.  Reason
appears to be that it is possible to interrupt the beginRead() method

CONNECTORS-677: Close body streams where required.

connector.

CONNECTORS-618: MySQL orders indexes so that NULL values are first.
This is a problem for the stuffer query, which then must go through
millions of rows before it finds the one it is looking for.
(Shigeki Kobayashi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-616: Work around Solr 4.0 or Jetty bug where connections
are dropped randomly under multithreaded load.  Broken pipe exceptions
are now retried after a minute, for up to three times, before the Solr
connector concludes that the document cannot be indexed and skips it.
(Shinichiro Abe, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-613: Add a way of getting a document's mime type

documents.
(David Morana, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-607: Handle multi-valued parameters properly in the

CONNECTORS-578: Refactor Livelink connector, and add support for
general metadata.
(David Morana, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-584: Fix MySQL use of indexes on ORDER-BY stuffing query.
Turns out that MySQL will not order by an index unless only the first column
in the index is specified in the ordering criteria.  Still need to check if this
breaks other databases like PostgreSQL, Derby, or HSQLDB.

connector.
(David Morana, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-575: Modify Livelink connector build to use stub only when
there is no lapi.jar available.  This is to support the fact that lapi jars are
not compatible from release to release, class-wise, so clients will need to
build this connector against the jar that they have, instead of the jar that
we have.
(David Morana, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-577: Typo in language message properties which cause stack
traces
(Erlend Garåsen)

(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-440: Build should exclude integration content from external
sources.

by ManifoldCF.resetEnvironment().
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-420: Revise the way we use Velocity so that we can make
better use of it for internationalization purposes, and for things like loops
etc.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-419: Alfresco Connector needs to invoke the ingestDocument for each d:content property of a node
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-417: CMIS Connector creates documentURI with wrong value when version is null.
Now the documentURI to get the content stream is retrieved from the CMIS server using an internal method of the OpenCMIS API.
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-416: Fix web connector authentication tab.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-415: Fix script language documentation.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-409: Set mcf-ui-core.jar to all the examples lib.
(Shinichiro Abe)

CONNECTORS-408: Rearrange the script-engine directory in a manner
consistent with other dist directories, and also use a different env variable
(ENGINE_HOME) so that we don't conflict with MCF_HOME.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-407: Set the executable bit in the distribution directory
for .sh files during ant build.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-405: Do not include sources in binary distribution.  This
is no longer essential since we deliver built jars for all the connectors
now.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-327: Share the web applications among all the examples.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-402: Change the ant build process to produce two artifacts -
one with proprietary material, and the other without.  This allows for
releases that include built connectors even though we do not ship the
proprietary material.
(Karl Wright, Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-403: Fix the sidecar process scripts to use the same
definition for MCF_HOME as everything else uses.  Also promote these

option, and modify the CMIS connector's UI to use it as an example.
(Piergiorgio Lucidi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-391: Multiprocess example web apps didn't work, due to missing
jars.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-390: JDBC drivers cannot work from anything other than the
root classpath.  This is because of a flaw with JDBC.  I've changed the instructions
accordingly, and provided built-in support for all drivers the JDBC connector
knows about.
(Karl Wright)

(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-329: Upgrade to OpenCMIS 0.6.0

CONNECTORS-366: Internationalized Solr connector fully.
(Hitoshi Ozawa, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-318: Add debugging output for XML parsing errors.  The
code assumes UTF-8 encoding of the stream, and only outputs the first 64K.
This should be sufficient for most situations though.
(Martin Goldhahn, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-355: Fix some remaining uninternationalized strings.
(Hitoshi Ozawa)

CONNECTORS-353: Ship .wsdd configuration files as part of connector
jars rather than separate files with configuration parameters.  This

in the Alfresco and CMIS connectors.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-342: Fix bad HTML in the File System connector.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-330: Add infrastructure that permits the database class
to initialize a connection every time it is pulled from the pool.  This is
necessary to support HSQLDB, because a number of HSQLDB's states
are actually maintained in the JDBC driver and thus cannot be managed
well in a pooled connection paradigm.
(Fred Toussi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-321: Correct a problem with external HSQLDB databases
where the schema wasn't being reliably set for the session.
(Fred Toussi, Karl Wright)

with schema discovery.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-308: Get the alfresco connector integration tests to run
under ant.
(Piergiorgio Lucidi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-310: Get the alfresco connector to build with Maven on a clean
system.  This involves pushing some of the dependencies that are not available
via the current maven repository into the local repository.  I wound up just
changing the bouncycastle dep to 140 instead of 137, but did not change the
others because I wasn't sure of the potential effects.
(Piergiorgio Lucidi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-311: added missing licenses
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-312: Move the Meridio web service into a separate package,
like we did for the SharePoint 3.0 plugin.

(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-303: Maven build doesn't consider HTML and JS files for the connector
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-284: HSQLDB runs out of memory on an extended load
test, and had other problems too.  A new version of the db software was
needed to correct this issue.  Thanks to the HSQLDB team for their
assistance!
(Fred Toussi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-299: Handle Postgresql 9.1's newfound ability to throw
deadlock conditions on transaction ends.
(Erlend Garåsen, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-298: Improve the SSL error message when no trusted
certs are found.

Building the SharePoint connector to how-to-build-and-deploy.html.
(Shinichiro Abe)

CONNECTORS-295: Add the support for multivalue properties
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-296: Make independent the configuration against the WARs version for integration tests
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-292: Problems with mvn-bootstrap.bat.  Also excluded (hopefully
temporarily) the HSQLDBext tests from the Maven build, since their properties.xml
conflict with HSQLDB tests.
(Luca Stancapiano, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-293: Fix the how-to-build-and-deploy documentation to include
the right version of jcifs.
(Luca Stancapiano, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-290: Revamp the way docpriorities are handled so as to avoid
flooding the jobqueue with documents that have a docpriority value but
a job or document status incompatible with stuffing.  This should help a lot
in very large crawls with multiple jobs.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-291: Active Directory authority reconnect logic had a
pathological case when server forcibly closed connection.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-209: Add support for remote HSQLDB instances.  There are
now configuration parameters for specifying protocol, server, and instance
name, which if specified cause the HSQLDB driver to communicate to the
specified remote instance.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-287: An Alfresco connector would be helpful
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-289: Wrong version of the OpenCMIS InMemory Server war in the page How to build and deploy
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-285: Provide a way through the IJobManager interface
and through the API to check on the status of a job without asking
for the counts of documents, which yields a full table scan.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-279: Prevent reindex or analyze from taking place within
a transaction.  This was causing hangs on our load tests.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-283: Upgrade to jcifs.jar 1.3.17 in the ant build (download-dependencies target).
(Shinichiro Abe)

CONNECTORS-282: Change order in which the incremental ingester does
things so we don't typically get unique constraint violation warnings in
the log.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-280: The job state "DELETESTARTINGUP" was not being
checked for in the status.  This meant that during the time that a
job delete was beginning, "Not yet run" would be displayed as the status.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-277: Add the ability to select namespaces and title
prefixes to the Wiki connector.
(Tobias Wunderlich, Karl Wright)

affected the wiki connector in a big way.
(Tobias Wunderlich, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-256: Add a Wiki connector, including basic sanity tests
and build logic.
(Karl Wright, Tobias Wunderlich)

CONNECTORS-270: The OpenSearchServer connector pom.xml was incorrect,
and skipped the resources needed to run the connector properly.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-269: Get the maven build working properly again, including
the HSQLDB tests, and the clean operation.
(Piergiorgio Lucidi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-264: Changing the repositoryId to an empty value is not possible
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-265: removed from the CMIS Connector all the HTML snippets from the Java code
