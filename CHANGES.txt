(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-553: Add email connector.
(Tishan DahanaYakage, Piergiorgio Lucidi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-846: Once a service had grabbed all connector
instances, but was not using them any more, it would not release
them for other cluster members to use.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-844: Remove "per JVM" from connection maximum
messages in crawler UI.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-842: Update documentation to describe the functioning
of the org.apache.manifoldcf.mysql.client property.
(Chris Griffin, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-843: Solr Connector methods do not call getSession()
when they should, leading to unpredictable results.
(Markus Schuch, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-841: Always reset document schedules on job start.
(David Morana, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-839: Fix our CloudSolrServer usage to use multipart
post instead of putting everything in the URL.
(Alessandro Benedetti, Raymond Wiker, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-838: Character-stuff names that ZooKeeper sees, to
prevent issues with '/' characters.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-837: Specifying 1 connection causes hang.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-836: Use the same thread context in the registered
shutdown objects.

the interface/factory paradigm.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-830: Stuffer thread throttling now works globally, not
just locally.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-781: Add support for multiple agents processes.  This
ticket involved changing much of the underlying infrastructure for
the framework, including adding lock manager features, revamping the
agents framework, building tests, and adding schema features that
allow for an agents process failure.  All in all, a very significant change,
which could well have introduced various instabilities.  Please don't
hesitate to note any issues.

that it doesn't understand when enumerating list contents, because
under some configurations, SharePoint lists things that aren't list items
there.
(Mark Libucha, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-810: Update JDBC connector documentation, and add
documentation for the JDBC authority connector.

CONNECTORS-803: Add automatic and manual ability to clean out
repohistory rows.
(Marcello Lorenzi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-801: Refactor JDBC authority to bring it into compliance with current
conventions in JDBC connector.  Warning: this change is not backwards
compatible!  JDBC authority queries now require explicit return column
names for the user id and token queries!
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-798: Bring JDBC connector support for CLOBs into the
modern era.  This also required extension of the CharacterInputFile

database table for the jobstatus screen.
(Graeme Seaton, Karl Wright)

tags that aren't nested as expected.  CDATA parsing was also broken.
(Benjamin Brandmeier, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-792: Introduce concepts of authorization domain

is to support federated authorization models such as what SharePoint
Claim Space fundamentally does, where there are multiple authorities
per repository.
WARNING: Schema change!
(Karl Wright)

======================= Release 1.4 =====================

CONNECTORS-791: Broken WHERE clause in job status query.

(Dmitry Goldenberg, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-778: Add support for attachments in SharePoint
connector.
(Dmitry Goldenberg, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-772: SharePoint connector wasn't working against
certain SharePoint instances.  The reason was that some paths
were relative and some absolute.  Fixed ALL path management to
have stronger check logic so bad paths are detected, warned, and
skipped.
(Dmitry Goldenberg, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-775: Use httpclient 4.2.6.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-774: Add support for proxies to Wiki connector.

CONNECTORS-750: Skip files when catching FileNotFoundException,
e.g. access/permission denied files in FileConnector.
(Shinichiro Abe)

appearing in HTML pages.
(Maciej Lizewski, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-751: RequestMinimum field not handled properly in API.
(Maciej Lizewski, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-749: HDFSRepositoryConnector can not fetch files.

that jobqueue is reanalyzed more frequently.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-681: ElasticSearch and OpenSearchServer connectors
both misused the File object passed to them in checkFileIndexable()
in order to see if the extension was a supported one.  Instead they
should have been checking the URL.  Added that code as well as changed
the JCIFS connector to check indexability using the URL means.
(konrad, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-679: Web connector hangs during throttling.  Reason
appears to be that it is possible to interrupt the beginRead() method
after it goes into "obtain estimate" mode.  Added code to make it clean

(Erlend Garåsen, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-677: Close body streams where required.

CONNECTORS-647: Add the resource.name hint to the Solr output
connector.
(Maciej Li¿ewski, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-623: A better fix, overriding the posting method for
SolrJ and forcing multipart post.  Although still a hack, this should cause
the behavior to work like MCF 1.0.1 now.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-645: Handle null data properly in worker thread.
(Maciej Li¿ewski, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-644: Restart button did not work.

This was causing Solrj to not work on multiprocess deployments.
(Erlend Garåsen, Karl Wright) 

CONNECTORS-618: MySQL orders indexes so that NULL values are first.
This is a problem for the stuffer query, which then must go through
millions of rows before it finds the one it is looking for.
(Shigeki Kobayashi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-616: Work around Solr 4.0 or Jetty bug where connections
are dropped randomly under multithreaded load.  Broken pipe exceptions
are now retried after a minute, for up to three times, before the Solr
connector concludes that the document cannot be indexed and skips it.
(Shinichiro Abe, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-613: Add a way of getting a document's mime type
to Solr, since Tika needs mime type in order to extract content
since Solr 4.0.0.

with solrj, so disable retries explicitly.
(Ahmet Arslan, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-609: Solrj doesn't always set the code property of
its http exceptions right, so we need to parse it out ourselves.

documents.
(David Morana, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-607: Handle multi-valued parameters properly in the

CONNECTORS-605: Maven build is broken: commons-httpclient version is missing
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-601: Revise algorithm for screening out documents that
are not text in the web connector.  Since CJK characters mess up the
old definition of "strange" character, use the more-limited definition of
all non-whitespace characters less than 32.
(Shinichiro Abe, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-600: Add a field to the RSS connector that contains
document origination date in ISO 8601 format.

(Maciej Li¿ewski, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-578: Refactor Livelink connector, and add support for
general metadata.
(David Morana, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-584: Fix MySQL use of indexes on ORDER-BY stuffing query.
Turns out that MySQL will not order by an index unless only the first column
in the index is specified in the ordering criteria.  Still need to check if this
breaks other databases like PostgreSQL, Derby, or HSQLDB.
(Shigeki Kobayashi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-583: Catch MySQL lock timeout, and retry that transaction.
(Shigeki Kobayashi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-579: Add untrusted, unverified https support to the RSS
connector.
(David Morana, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-575: Modify Livelink connector build to use stub only when
there is no lapi.jar available.  This is to support the fact that lapi jars are
not compatible from release to release, class-wise, so clients will need to
build this connector against the jar that they have, instead of the jar that
we have.
(David Morana, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-577: Typo in language message properties which cause stack
traces
(Erlend Garåsen)

CONNECTORS-420: Revise the way we use Velocity so that we can make
better use of it for internationalization purposes, and for things like loops
etc.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-419: Alfresco Connector needs to invoke the ingestDocument for each d:content property of a node
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-417: CMIS Connector creates documentURI with wrong value when version is null. 
Now the documentURI to get the content stream is retrieved from the CMIS server using an internal method of the OpenCMIS API.
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-415: Fix script language documentation.
(Karl Wright)

(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-407: Set the executable bit in the distribution directory
for .sh files during ant build.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-405: Do not include sources in binary distribution.  This

now.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-327: Share the web applications among all the examples.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-402: Change the ant build process to produce two artifacts -
one with proprietary material, and the other without.  This allows for
releases that include built connectors even though we do not ship the
proprietary material.
(Karl Wright, Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-403: Fix the sidecar process scripts to use the same
definition for MCF_HOME as everything else uses.  Also promote these

CONNECTORS-391: Multiprocess example web apps didn't work, due to missing
jars.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-390: JDBC drivers cannot work from anything other than the
root classpath.  This is because of a flaw with JDBC.  I've changed the instructions

knows about.
(Karl Wright)

(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-329: Upgrade to OpenCMIS 0.6.0

CONNECTORS-318: Add debugging output for XML parsing errors.  The
code assumes UTF-8 encoding of the stream, and only outputs the first 64K.
This should be sufficient for most situations though.
(Martin Goldhahn, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-355: Fix some remaining uninternationalized strings.
(Hitoshi Ozawa)

CONNECTORS-353: Ship .wsdd configuration files as part of connector
jars rather than separate files with configuration parameters.  This

in the Alfresco and CMIS connectors.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-342: Fix bad HTML in the File System connector.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-330: Add infrastructure that permits the database class
to initialize a connection every time it is pulled from the pool.  This is
necessary to support HSQLDB, because a number of HSQLDB's states
are actually maintained in the JDBC driver and thus cannot be managed
well in a pooled connection paradigm.
(Fred Toussi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-321: Correct a problem with external HSQLDB databases
where the schema wasn't being reliably set for the session.
(Fred Toussi, Karl Wright)

with schema discovery.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-308: Get the alfresco connector integration tests to run
under ant.
(Piergiorgio Lucidi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-310: Get the alfresco connector to build with Maven on a clean
system.  This involves pushing some of the dependencies that are not available
via the current maven repository into the local repository.  I wound up just
changing the bouncycastle dep to 140 instead of 137, but did not change the
others because I wasn't sure of the potential effects.
(Piergiorgio Lucidi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-311: added missing licenses
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-303: Maven build doesn't consider HTML and JS files for the connector
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-284: HSQLDB runs out of memory on an extended load
test, and had other problems too.  A new version of the db software was
needed to correct this issue.  Thanks to the HSQLDB team for their
assistance!
(Fred Toussi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-299: Handle Postgresql 9.1's newfound ability to throw

(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-296: Make independent the configuration against the WARs version for integration tests
(Piergiorgio Lucidi)

CONNECTORS-292: Problems with mvn-bootstrap.bat.  Also excluded (hopefully
temporarily) the HSQLDBext tests from the Maven build, since their properties.xml
conflict with HSQLDB tests.
(Luca Stancapiano, Karl Wright)
