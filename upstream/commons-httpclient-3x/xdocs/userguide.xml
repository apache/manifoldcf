    <section name="User Guide">
      <p>The HttpClient user guide is designed to help developers use
      HttpClient in their applications.  While the concept of a user guide
      being for developers may seem strange, the term developer is
      already in use for people helping to develop HttpClient.</p>

      <p>If you are new to HttpClient, make sure to work through the
         <a href="tutorial.html">Tutorial</a> and have a look at the
<a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpcomponents/oac.hc3x/trunk/src/examples/">Sample Code</a>.
         Before reporting problems, read about
         <a href="troubleshooting.html">Trouble Shooting</a>
