For the jcifs connector, certain changes were made to jcifs itself to
work reliably with Samba systems.  This set of upstream changes is
encapsulated in the following file:

jcifs.diffs, against version 1.3.9 as downloaded from http://jcifs.samba.org.

To run this connector, copy the jcifs.jar into this directory, and run
ManifoldCF in the normal way.  You can read more about the
process on the "how-to-build-and-deploy.html" documentation page.
